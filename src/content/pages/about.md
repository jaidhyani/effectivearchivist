This blog contains my favorite vegan and lacto-vegetarian recipes.

I'm a huge dietary restriction nerd, so all of the recipes are tagged according to which restrictions they safely meet. If you have a dietary restriction that isn't represented in my tags, I would super excited to hear about it.

Most of the dishes are modified from recipes I found online, some updated to remove egg/meat, others tweaked for tastiness or for cooking ease. When possible, I've linked to the original recipe.

A few things that are different about my recipes compared to other recipe blogs:

 	Ingredient preparation is part of the recipe:

 	peeling, chopping, rinsing, etc. are all included as steps in the recipe, interspersed with other cooking steps in the way that I find to be most time efficient

 	Weights for ingredients in addition to volume

 	some things are easier to measure by weight, so I've been going back and updating recipes to includes weights for all ingredients
