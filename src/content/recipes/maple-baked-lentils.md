instructions:
  - type: "step"
    text: Place lentils in a large pot and add 4 cups water. Turn heat to high and bring to a boil. 
  - type: "step"
    text: "Pre-cook the sweet potato by piercing the skin in a few places with a fork, microwaving on high for 30 seconds, rotating, then microwaving on high for another 30 seconds. The goal isn't to cook the sweet potato, it just helps speed up the bake time a little bit."
  - type: "step"
    text: "After the lentils begin to boil, reduce heat to low-medium and simmer for about 30 minutes, uncovered, stirring often. Add more water if needed - the lentils are done when they are tender (but not mushy) and most of the water is absorbed."
  - type: "step"
    text: Preheat oven to 375º F (190º C).
  - type: "step"
    text: "Dice the yellow onion, mince/press the garlic, peel and dice the apple. Peel and dice the sweet potato."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Combine the sweet potato, onion, garlic, apple, tomatoes (with juice), maple syrup, agave, mustard, salt, black pepper, apple cider vinegar, and lentils - stir until well-mixed."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Place the mixture in a 9x13 baking dish, cover with tin foil, and bake for 20-25 minutes."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Remove from oven, uncover, and stir. Bake for another 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the sweet potato is tender."

A weird tangy-sweet casserole. Very controversial - I like it, but I'm not sure why.
