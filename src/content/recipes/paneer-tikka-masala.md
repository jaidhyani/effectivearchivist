    text: "Cut the paneer into 1-centimeter cubes. Spread the paneer in a single layer on a baking pan, and pour the yogurt mixture over top. Broil for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and stir.  Return to oven for 4-10 minutes, depending on how hot your oven runs. You can judge whether to reduce the interval time by looking at the color of the cheese - aim for golden with no dark brown or burnt bits. Continue to broil/stir in 4-10 minute intervals until the paneer is golden brown on all sides and the yogurt sauce has cooked off, about 40 minutes."
