instructions:
  - type: "step"
    text: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over low-medium heat while you dice the onion.
  - type: "step"
    text: "Add the onion and saute, stirring periodically, until all pieces are soft and at least some of them are golden brown - about 30-40 minutes. If some onions start to burn, call it done."
  - type: "step"
    text: "While the onion is cooking, drain the can(s) of chickpeas, then peel and dice the apples. Measure the curry powder, tumeric, garam masala, and salt into a small bowl."
  - type: "step"
    text: "When the onion is done, add the spice mixture. Stir constantly for about 2 minutes. The goal is to completely coat the onion, but not let it stick to the pan."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Add the agave, chickpeas, apple, and raisins, and stir until all of the new additions are a consistent color.  Turn up the heat a notch, cover and stir occasionally, roughly every 10-15 minutes, until the raisins are bloated and the apples are very soft - about 35-40 minutes."
