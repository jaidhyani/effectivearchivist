instructions:
  - type: "step"
    text: "Prepare the ingredients: dice the onions. Peel and mince/press the garlic. Peel, seed, and dice the butternut squash into almond-size pieces. Peel and dice the sweet potato, also into almond-size pieces. You can chop the squash and potato into larger pieces if you want, but it will increase the simmer time in Step 5."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Saute the olive oil, onion, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat for 4-8 minutes, until the onion is softened. While the onion is softening, rinse the red lentils (or drain and rinse the chickpeas, if using those instead of lentils)"
  - type: "step"
    text: Add the squash and sweet potato and stir to combine. Add a pinch of salt and continue stirring for 1-2 minutes.
  - type: "step"
    text: "Add the vegetable broth, diced tomatoes (with juices), coconut milk, red lentils, tomato paste, turmeric, ground cumin, curry powder, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Increase heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, stir again, and simmer uncovered for about an hour, stirring occasionally, until the squash and potato are easily stabbed through with a fork and are starting to dissolve. Reduce the heat when the bottom of the pot starts to burn."
  - type: "step"
    text: "While the stew is simmering, stem and coarsely chop the chard."
  - type: "step"
    text: "After the squash and potato are done cooking, add the apple cider vinegar. Taste and adjust the other seasonings (eg. salt, black pepper, curry powder, chili powder) if desired."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Stir in the chard, and cook for another couple minutes until the leaves are wilted."
