instructions:
  - type: "step"
    text: "Drain the tofu and press it. (That is - put it in the middle of a baking sheet or something else flat that will catch the water you're squeezing out, put another large flat piece of cookware on top, then weigh it down with lots of heavy pans or cookbooks.) Press the tofu for at least 30 minutes."
  - type: "step"
    text: "While the tofu is pressing: Grate, press, or mince the garlic. Zest the lemon. A microplane is the ideal tool for both grating and zesting, if you have one available."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Make the marinade by combining the garlic, lemon zest, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, tamari, maple syrup, basil, oregano, thyme, and pepper in a bowl. Whisk to mix."
  - type: "step"
    text: "Cut the tofu into roughly 2-centimeter cubes and add to the marinade, trying to cover as much of the tofu as possible. Marinate in the fridge for at least half an hour, as long as overnight. If possible, stir occasionally."
